// The provided Rust code defines an AdvancedTradingManager for sophisticated token trading strategies. 

// Its main functions and implementation details are:

// Risk Profiling: Classifies tokens into risk categories (Low, Medium, High, VeryHigh) based on metrics like market cap, volume, buy/sell ratio, and token age.

// Entry Criteria Calculation: Uses technical indicators (momentum, volatility, buy/sell ratio, liquidity growth, market sentiment) and bonding curve analysis to determine if a token has a buy signal and calculates an entry confidence score.

// Dynamic Exit Strategy: Sets multi-level take-profit and stop-loss thresholds tailored to the token's risk profile, including trailing stops and time-based exits.

// Position Sizing: Applies the Kelly criterion to determine optimal position size based on confidence and portfolio value, with safety caps.

// Trade Evaluation: Evaluates tokens for entry signals, checks if trading is active, and decides position size before logging the trade decision.
